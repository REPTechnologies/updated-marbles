      <h3>Our Story...</h3>
      <p>marbles.mx is intended to turn your technology to work for you.  Instead of tech determining how we feel and interact with people, marbles.mx helps you interact with unique opportunities, events, and people, all to help you live a happier, healthier life.</p>
      <p>Anyone can submit safe, public events that are designed to offer community members an enriching experience, not to sell you something. Then, the event attendees rate the events and determine if this opportunity was worthwhile. marbles users have all the power to explore different local events and provide real-time feedback to other community members and event organizers so everyone, event organizers and attendees have great, life-filling experiences!</p>
