  We often spend most of our day on autopilot. Doing daily chores, eating, cleaning, bathing, walking to class or on the bus… all these things require very little mental energy. However, these are also really great opportunities to learn more about the world around us and ourselves. If we spend our time buried in technology or our revolving thoughts, we can miss opportunities to try new things and grow. Developing momentary awareness is crucial in our company’s journey to start doing what we love and sharing the knowledge. Simply developing momentary awareness of what we are thinking, doing, and experiencing can help us notice some of the small joys that often go over looked in our busy lives. Take a moment, expand your awareness, and be joyful.

Nothing is perfect; no action, person, or idea…everything has room to grow and expand. Developing balance in our daily lives is paramount to living healthy as well. Whether it’s going to the gym, taking strides towards a career, or mending a relationship, it can be challenging to decide which is more important. Marbles is designed to help take some of the pressure off. By checking in every day, you can literally see when you are out of balance! We also offer the best ways to get back to where you want to be: living well.
